-- SUMMARY --

Charts and Graphs is a API for developers. It can easily be extended by
third-party modules that want to add their own charting implementations. It does
nothing by itself. It should only be installed if some other module requires it.

See Views Charts <http://drupal.org/project/views_charts> for usage of a
user-centric application as the Charts and Graphs module is a framework +
collection of implementation modules (under the api folder). Please read
README/INSTALL files of the implementations since their installation may involve
downloading flash components or third-party libraries. Drupal guidelines does
not always allow packaging those with Drupal code.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
